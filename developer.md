## 📋 Development Log

### 2024-12-19 - Project Initialization

#### Decision: Backend Technology Stack Change
**Context**: Original project was set up with Node.js/TypeScript backend, but requirements changed to Python backend.

**Decision**: Migrate backend from Node.js to Python with FastAPI framework.

**Rationale**:
- FastAPI provides excellent performance and automatic API documentation
- Python ecosystem has strong libraries for data processing, scraping, and ML
- Better integration with data science tools for lead scoring and enrichment
- Type hints and Pydantic models provide similar type safety to TypeScript

**Implementation Plan**:
1. Keep existing frontend (React/TypeScript) as it's well-suited for the UI requirements
2. Replace Node.js backend with Python FastAPI
3. Maintain modular architecture with OOP principles
4. Add Redis caching for performance
5. Update all documentation to reflect changes

#### Challenge: Maintaining Modular Architecture
**Issue**: Need to ensure Python backend maintains the same modular structure as the original Node.js design.

**Resolution**: 
- Use Python packages and modules to create clear separation
- Implement service layer pattern with dependency injection
- Use abstract base classes for interfaces
- Maintain consistent directory structure

#### Decision: Database ORM Choice
**Context**: Need to choose between SQLAlchemy, Django ORM, or other Python ORMs.

**Decision**: Use SQLAlchemy with Alembic for migrations.

**Rationale**:
- SQLAlchemy is the most mature and flexible ORM for Python
- Alembic provides excellent migration management
- Better integration with FastAPI
- Supports both SQLAlchemy Core and ORM patterns

#### Decision: Authentication Strategy
**Context**: Need to implement JWT authentication in Python.

**Decision**: Use python-jose for JWT handling with passlib for password hashing.

**Rationale**:
- python-jose is the most widely used JWT library for Python
- passlib provides secure password hashing with bcrypt
- Both libraries are well-maintained and secure

#### Decision: Caching Strategy
**Context**: Need to implement Redis caching for performance optimization.

**Decision**: Use redis-py with connection pooling and serialization.

**Rationale**:
- redis-py is the official Redis client for Python
- Connection pooling improves performance
- JSON serialization for complex objects
- TTL-based cache invalidation

### 2024-12-19 - Project Structure Decisions

**Version**: 1.0.0 

### 2024-12-20 - Company Data Enrichment Module

#### Decision: Add Company Data Enrichment Service
**Context**: Need to enrich scraped company data with funding, tech stack, employee count, etc., using third-party APIs (Clearbit, Apollo, etc.).

**Decision**: Implement `EnrichmentService` as an OOP, modular, and independently testable class in `services/enrichment/enrichment.py`.

**Rationale**:
- Centralizes enrichment logic for all scrapers
- Allows fallback between multiple APIs (Clearbit, Apollo)
- Easy to extend with new providers
- Can be tested independently with mock data

**Implementation Notes**:
- Service takes normalized company dict and returns enriched dict
- Tries Clearbit first; if missing data, falls back to Apollo
- Logs all enrichment attempts, successes, and failures
- Integrated into all scrapers after normalization, before caching/storage
- Stubbed API calls for now; ready for real API integration
- Documented usage and API details in module-level README
- Updated design.md and checkpoints.md with workflow and milestone

**Errors & Fixes**:
- None encountered during initial implementation (stubbed APIs)
- If enrichment fails, original data is returned and error is logged 

### 2025-07-15 - AI-Powered Company Summarization

#### Decision: Add SummarizerService using GPT-4
**Context:** Need to generate concise, business-focused company summaries for dashboards and lead cards.

**Decision:**
- Implemented `SummarizerService` using OpenAI GPT-4 API.
- Handles API errors and rate limits gracefully.
- Integrated into `EnrichmentService` pipeline after enrichment.
- Output includes a `summary` field if a description is present and summarization succeeds.
- Updated module-level README.md with usage, troubleshooting, and configuration.
- Documented value, limitations, and future improvements.

**Rationale:**
- Improves user experience by surfacing key company information at a glance.
- Modular, testable, and extensible for future enhancements. 

### 2025-07-15 - Customizable Lead Scoring Engine

#### Decision: Add LeadScoringEngine with rule-based and future ML/LLM support
**Context:** Need to score leads for prioritization and analytics.

**Decision:**
- Implemented `LeadScoringEngine` with configurable rule-based logic.
- Stub method for future ML/LLM-based scoring.
- Integrated into enrichment pipeline; output now includes a `score` field.
- Updated module-level README.md with usage and configuration.

**Rationale:**
- Modular, testable, and extensible for future enhancements.
- Enables both business rules and AI-driven scoring. 

### 2025-07-15 - Bug Fix: OpenAI Error Handling in SummarizerService

- Fixed exception handling to use correct import (`from openai import error as openai_error`).
- Updated all OpenAI API error handling to use `openai_error.RateLimitError` and `openai_error.OpenAIError`.
- This ensures the enrichment and scoring pipeline continues even if summarization fails, and the score field is always present in the output.
