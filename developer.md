## 📋 Development Log

### 2024-12-19 - Project Initialization

#### Decision: Backend Technology Stack Change
**Context**: Original project was set up with Node.js/TypeScript backend, but requirements changed to Python backend.

**Decision**: Migrate backend from Node.js to Python with FastAPI framework.

**Rationale**:
- FastAPI provides excellent performance and automatic API documentation
- Python ecosystem has strong libraries for data processing, scraping, and ML
- Better integration with data science tools for lead scoring and enrichment
- Type hints and Pydantic models provide similar type safety to TypeScript

**Implementation Plan**:
1. Keep existing frontend (React/TypeScript) as it's well-suited for the UI requirements
2. Replace Node.js backend with Python FastAPI
3. Maintain modular architecture with OOP principles
4. Add Redis caching for performance
5. Update all documentation to reflect changes

#### Challenge: Maintaining Modular Architecture
**Issue**: Need to ensure Python backend maintains the same modular structure as the original Node.js design.

**Resolution**: 
- Use Python packages and modules to create clear separation
- Implement service layer pattern with dependency injection
- Use abstract base classes for interfaces
- Maintain consistent directory structure

#### Decision: Database ORM Choice
**Context**: Need to choose between SQLAlchemy, Django ORM, or other Python ORMs.

**Decision**: Use SQLAlchemy with Alembic for migrations.

**Rationale**:
- SQLAlchemy is the most mature and flexible ORM for Python
- Alembic provides excellent migration management
- Better integration with FastAPI
- Supports both SQLAlchemy Core and ORM patterns

#### Decision: Authentication Strategy
**Context**: Need to implement JWT authentication in Python.

**Decision**: Use python-jose for JWT handling with passlib for password hashing.

**Rationale**:
- python-jose is the most widely used JWT library for Python
- passlib provides secure password hashing with bcrypt
- Both libraries are well-maintained and secure

#### Decision: Caching Strategy
**Context**: Need to implement Redis caching for performance optimization.

**Decision**: Use redis-py with connection pooling and serialization.

**Rationale**:
- redis-py is the official Redis client for Python
- Connection pooling improves performance
- JSON serialization for complex objects
- TTL-based cache invalidation

### 2024-12-19 - Project Structure Decisions

#### Decision: Module Organization
**Context**: Need to organize Python modules for scraping, enrichment, scoring, etc.

**Decision**: Use feature-based module organization:

```
backend/
├── app/
│   ├── api/                 # API routes
│   ├── core/               # Core configuration and utilities
│   ├── models/             # Database models
│   ├── schemas/            # Pydantic schemas
│   ├── services/           # Business logic services
│   │   ├── scraping/       # Web scraping services
│   │   ├── enrichment/     # Data enrichment services
│   │   ├── scoring/        # Lead scoring services
│   │   └── analytics/      # Analytics services
│   ├── repositories/       # Data access layer

**Rationale**:
- Simpler setup for new developers
- Better Docker integration
- Widely understood and used
- Easy to maintain

#### Decision: Development Tools
**Context**: Need to set up linting, formatting, and testing tools for Python.

**Decision**: 
- **Linting**: flake8 with black for formatting
- **Testing**: pytest with pytest-asyncio
- **Type Checking**: mypy
- **Pre-commit**: pre-commit hooks

**Rationale**:
- Industry standard tools
- Good integration with FastAPI
- Comprehensive code quality checks

### 2024-12-19 - API Design Decisions

#### Decision: API Structure
**Context**: Need to design RESTful API endpoints for lead management.

**Decision**: Use FastAPI with automatic OpenAPI documentation.

**Endpoints Structure**:
```
/api/v1/
├── auth/           # Authentication endpoints
├── leads/          # Lead management
├── companies/      # Company data
├── analytics/      # Analytics and reporting
├── scraping/       # Scraping management
├── enrichment/     # Data enrichment
└── scoring/        # Lead scoring
```

**Rationale**:
- FastAPI provides automatic OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- RESTful design principles
- Versioned API for future compatibility
- Clear resource-based organization

#### Decision: Response Format
**Context**: Need to standardize API response format.

**Decision**: Use consistent response wrapper with Pydantic models.

```python
class ApiResponse(BaseModel):
    success: bool
    data: Optional[Any] = None
    error: Optional[str] = None
    message: Optional[str] = None
```

**Rationale**:
- Consistent API responses
- Type safety with Pydantic
