## CrunchbaseScraper Feature

### Usefulness
- Enables automated, repeatable lead data extraction from Crunchbase.
- Caches results to avoid redundant requests and reduce API/scraping load.
- Normalizes data for downstream analytics and enrichment.
- OOP design makes it easy to add new sources and extend functionality.

### Implementation
- `CrunchbaseScraper` class in `app/services/scraping/crunchbase.py`.
- Methods: `fetch_company`, `parse_company`, `normalize_company`, `_store_in_db`.
- Uses Redis for caching (company name as key, 1 hour TTL).
- Logging and error handling throughout.
- DB storage is stubbed for now; will use SQLAlchemy in future.
- Designed for extensibility: new sources = new classes.

### Design Rationale
- OOP: Encapsulation, testability, and extensibility.
- Redis: Fast, simple, avoids duplicate work.
- Logging: Traceability and easier debugging.
- Modular: Each source is a separate class/module. 

## Additional Scraping Sources

### KasprScraper (LinkedIn via Kaspr API)
- **Value**: Provides enriched LinkedIn company and contact data, useful for B2B lead intelligence.
- **Integration**: Inherits from BaseScraper, uses Redis caching, logging, and OOP structure. Stubbed for now; ready for real API integration.

### AngelListScraper
- **Value**: Adds startup and founder data from AngelList, expanding the lead universe and providing early-stage company insights.
- **Integration**: Inherits from BaseScraper, uses Redis caching, logging, and OOP structure. Stubbed for now; ready for real API integration.

### GoogleMapsScraper
- **Value**: Adds geolocation, address, and contact info from Google Maps, improving data completeness and validation.
- **Integration**: Inherits from BaseScraper, uses Redis caching, logging, and OOP structure. Stubbed for now; ready for real API integration.

### Design Approach
- All scrapers follow the same interface and can be swapped or extended easily.
- Each module is independently testable and can be used in isolation or as part of a multi-source aggregation pipeline.
- Adding new sources is straightforward: subclass BaseScraper and implement the required methods.
